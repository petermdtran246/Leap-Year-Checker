# Leap Year Checker

This program determines whether a given year is a leap year or not.

## Algorithm
This program uses a nested if-else statement to determine whether a year is a leap year or not.
  -   year is considered a leap year if it is divisible by 4, except for years that are divisible by 100 but not by 400.
- The program assumes that the user will enter a valid integer value. If you want to handle non-numeric input, you can add additional error handling.
